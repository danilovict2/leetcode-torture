# Leetcode Torture

Firefox extension that forces you to solve one LeetCode problem before you can do anything in your browser.

## Motivation

I found [this cool extension][https://github.com/The-CodingSloth/haha-funny-leetcode-extension] and decided to port it to Firefox because, well, I use Firefox (LibreWolf actually üòä).
